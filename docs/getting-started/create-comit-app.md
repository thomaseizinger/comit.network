[`create-comit-app`](https://github.com/comit-network/create-comit-app/) is a project to help COMIT App developers setup an environment.
In this documentation we'll run you through:
- How to use `create-comit-app`,
- What does `create-comit-app` do and how can it be useful to you, a COMIT App dev,
- How to run one the provided example, i.e., run an atomic swap with local blockchain nodes.

While mainly written in Rust, it is actually shipped on [npmjs.com](https://npmjs.com) as two packages:
- [`create-comit-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-comit-app)
- [`comit-scripts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/comit-scripts)

While you can build your app in JavaScript, examples and the [SDK](https://github.com/comit-network/comit-js-sdk/) are written in TypeScript,
allowing you to also build in TypeScript.

To use either packages, you need to have [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed.
In this tutorial we will use `yarn` but it can be replaced by `npm` in any command below. 

## TL;DR - Quick Start

```
yarn create comit-app my-app
cd my-app/demos/btc_eth
yarn install
yarn run start-env
```

Once it says the `Environment is ready`, open a new terminal (keep the current terminal running):

```
cd my-app/demos/btc_eth
yarn run swap
```

Congratulations, you did a Bitcoin to Ether atomic swap!

## Long version

### create-comit-app

The `create-comit-app` allows you to create a template COMIT App which includes working examples.
To create your template app in the `my-app` directory, just do:

```
yarn create comit-app my-app
```
```
yarn create v1.21.1

Let's have a look at what we have here:

```
cd my-app
tree # You can alternatively use `ls -R`
```

- `.` is where you can start writing your app, see [write your app tuto](../tutorials/write-a-comit-app.md) 
- `./package.json` contains some useful dependencies for your app
- `./examples` contains projects that are made to inspire developers such as yourself to build their app
- `./demos` contains projects which are catered for workshops demonstration. They do not have a conventional structure but have verbose output.
 
 Let's have a look at [comit-scripts](#comit-scripts) before [running an demo](#run-a-demo) together.

### comit-scripts

The `comit-scripts` package helps you run a development environment to build a COMIT App.

Let's install it from the template folder to play with it.

```
cd my-app # Not needed if you are already in the `my-app` directory
yarn install
```
```
yarn install v1.21.1
info No lockfile found.
[1/4] 🔍  Resolving packages...
[2/4] 🚚  Fetching packages...
[3/4] 🔗  Linking dependencies...
[4/4] 🔨  Building fresh packages...
success Saved lockfile.
✨  Done in 92.81s.
```

Let's check out the provided `package.json` for any useful scripts:

```
cat package.json
```
```
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node ./src/index.js",
    "start-env": "comit-scripts start-env",
    "force-clean-env": "comit-scripts force-clean-env"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "comit-sdk": "^0.10.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "comit-scripts": "^0.8.3"
  }
}
```

As you can see, two scripts are using `comit-scripts`, let's run `start-env`:

```
yarn run start-env
```
```
yarn run v1.21.1
$ comit-scripts start-env
Creating Docker network (create-comit-app)...✓
Starting Ethereum node...✓
Starting Bitcoin node...✓
Starting two cnds...✓
Writing configuration in env file...✓
🎉 Environment is ready, time to create a COMIT app!
✓
```

Let's review in more details what `start-env` did:

#### `Creating Docker network (create-comit-app)...✓`

Creates a docker network to allow several docker containers to communicate with each others. The network is named `create-comit-app`.

#### `Starting Ethereum node...✓`

- Starts a parity node in a docker container,
- Deploys an ERC20 token contract
- Creates two accounts,
- Funds each account with 1000 Ethers and 100 ERC20 tokens.

#### `Starting Bitcoin node...✓`

- Starts a bitcoind node in a docker container,
- Creates two HD wallet,
- Funds each wallet with 10 Bitcoin,
- Mines a new block every second.

#### `Starting two cnds...✓`

Starts 2 cnd (COMIT Network Daemon) in docker containers.

---

Let's take a break and check out what containers are now running:

```
docker ps
```
```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                             ... NAMES
207bdd00d103        comitnetwork/cnd:0.4.0            ... cnd_1
e72b5910e530        comitnetwork/cnd:0.4.0            ... cnd_0
7c9855e6f3c0        coblox/bitcoin-core:0.17.0        ... bitcoin
66a52568666d        coblox/parity-poa:v2.5.9-stable   ... ethereum
```
Indeed we have bitcoind, parity and 2 cnds running.

#### `Writing configuration in env file...✓`

Writes useful information to `~/.create-comit-app/env`.

Let's have a look at this `env` file in more details:

```
cat ~/.create-comit-app/env
```
```  
BITCOIN_HD_KEY_0=tprv8ZgxMBicQKsPf8tkuTQ3eftSjgnE17mEaoNbDz8r7N9TQd...
BITCOIN_HD_KEY_1=tprv8ZgxMBicQKsPfCW2nYxkfxMnb49PyTYFCF7sdkHdNWBgm8...
BITCOIN_P2P_URI=127.0.0.1:58233
ERC20_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x62d69f6867a0a084c6d313943dc22023bc263691
ETHEREUM_KEY_0=77914ef506f41277bd62c9296143c68bbb8006d7c66619af42a626aced947654
ETHEREUM_KEY_1=f8ce18c1bf5c586ef2f89ed04d0296c49bf915483d2866decddd487dc83488c9
ETHEREUM_NODE_HTTP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:58176
HTTP_URL_CND_0=http://127.0.0.1:58248
HTTP_URL_CND_1=http://127.0.0.1:58249
```

We have here the private keys of the funded accounts on Ethereum and Bitcoin and the endpoint to the various services.
This can be used to be imported in my-app so that you can test it with funded accounts.

### Two cnds?

You may have noticed that you are getting 2 Bitcoin wallet, 2 Ethereum accounts and 2 cnd instances out of `start-env`.
This is simply due to the fact that one cannot do an atomic swap by themselves!

Atomic swap are inherently peer-to-peer.
One can only sell Bitcoin for Ether if someone else buys Bitcoin For Ether.
As you need two parties to do a swap, `start-env` gives you an environment for both parties.

### Shutdown

To stop the environment, just hit `CTRL+C` and wait few seconds:

```
yarn run start-env
```
```
yarn run v1.21.1
$ comit-scripts start-env
Creating Docker network (create-comit-app)...✓
Starting Ethereum node...✓
Starting Bitcoin node...✓
Starting two cnds...✓
Writing configuration in env file...✓
🎉 Environment is ready, time to create a COMIT app!
✓
^C🧹 Cleaning up...
✓
```

### Run a demo

The template COMIT App comes with a number of examples and demo projects that allows you to get inspired and run atomic swap between the various supported assets.

Let's run one of those demos to see how an atomic swap execution looks like:

```
cd demos/btc_eth
yarn install
```
```
yarn install v1.21.1
[1/4] 🔍  Resolving packages...
[2/4] 🚚  Fetching packages...
[3/4] 🔗  Linking dependencies...
[4/4] 🔨  Building fresh packages...
✨  Done in 72.77s.
```

If `start-env` from the previous section is still running, leave it. If not, you need to start it:
```
yarn run start-env
```
```
yarn run v1.21.1
$ comit-scripts start-env
First time execution, downloading comit-scripts 0.8.3...✓

Starting Ethereum node...✓
Starting Bitcoin node...✓
Starting two cnds...✓

🎉 Environment is ready, time to create a COMIT app!
✓
```

Then, from a new terminal:
```
cd my-app/demos/btc_eth
yarn run swap
```
```
yarn run v1.21.1
$ ts-node ./src/index.ts
